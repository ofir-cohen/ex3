# ex3 - Data Collection & Network Analysis

## Question 1

First, we load the requiered packeges:

```{r}
#install.packages("igraph")
#install.packages("digest")
#install.packages("rgl")
library("igraph")
library("digest")
library("rgl")
```

Then, we read the data into a graph

```{r}
ga.data <- read.csv('ga_edgelist.csv', header = T)
g <- graph.data.frame(ga.data,directed = F)
g$layout <- layout.fruchterman.reingold(g)
```

Next, we are asked about the biggest component in the graph, so we delete the vertices that are not part of it:
(we knew what the verticies were by plotting and inspecting the graph manually)

```{r}
g1 <- delete.vertices(g,c(24,11,10,12,25,26,31,13)) #delete anything but the biggest component
g1$layout <- layout.fruchterman.reingold(g1)
```
### a)

Now we will use the modified graph to check which actor has the highest cenerality rank by the 3 different methods:

### i)

using the following code:

```{r}
bet <- betweenness(g1, v = V(g1), directed = FALSE, weights = NULL,
            nobigint = TRUE, normalized = FALSE)
which(max(bet) == bet)
```
we discover that **sloan** is the actor with the highest bewtweenness rank.

### ii)

using the following code:

```{r}
clo <- closeness(g1, vids = V(g1),weights = NULL, normalized = FALSE)
which(max(clo) == clo)
```
we discover that **torres** is the actor with the highest closeness rank.

### iii)

using the following code:

```{r}
eig <- eigen_centrality(g1, directed = FALSE, scale = TRUE, weights = NULL,
                 options = arpack_defaults)
which(eig$vector == 1)
```
we discover that **karev** is the actor with the highest Eigenvector rank.

### b)

## Algorithm 1 - Girvan-Newman community detection (edge-bewtweenness)

using the following code:

```{r}
gc <-  edge.betweenness.community(g1)
memb <- membership(gc)
plot(g, vertex.size=5, #vertex.label=NA,
     vertex.color=memb, asp=FALSE)
View(gc)
```
we get:

### i)

The following colored graph:

### ii) 

The algorithm produced 6 communities with the sizes of 4,5,4,4,4,3 ordered by id.

### iii) 

The modularity value we got is 0.47

## Algorithm 2 -
