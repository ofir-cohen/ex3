# ex3 - Data Collection & Network Analysis

## Question 1

First, we load the requiered packeges:

```{r}
#install.packages("igraph")
#install.packages("digest")
#install.packages("rgl")
library("igraph")
library("digest")
library("rgl")
```

Then, we read the data into a graph

```{r}
ga.data <- read.csv('ga_edgelist.csv', header = T)
g <- graph.data.frame(ga.data,directed = F)
g$layout <- layout.fruchterman.reingold(g)
```

Next, we are asked about the biggest component in the graph, so we delete the vertices that are not part of it:
(we knew what the verticies were by plotting and inspecting the graph manually)

```{r}
g1 <- delete.vertices(g,c(24,11,10,12,25,26,31,13)) #delete anything but the biggest component
g1$layout <- layout.fruchterman.reingold(g1)
```
### a)

Now we will use the modified graph to check which actor has the highest cenerality rank by the 3 different methods:

### i)

using the following code:

```{r}
bet <- betweenness(g1, v = V(g1), directed = FALSE, weights = NULL,
            nobigint = TRUE, normalized = FALSE)
which(max(bet) == bet)
```
we discover that **sloan** is the actor with the highest bewtweenness rank.

### ii)

using the following code:

```{r}
clo <- closeness(g1, vids = V(g1),weights = NULL, normalized = FALSE)
which(max(clo) == clo)
```
we discover that **torres** is the actor with the highest closeness rank.

### iii)

using the following code:

```{r}
eig <- eigen_centrality(g1, directed = FALSE, scale = TRUE, weights = NULL,
                 options = arpack_defaults)
which(eig$vector == 1)
```
we discover that **karev** is the actor with the highest Eigenvector rank.

### b)

## Algorithm 1 - Girvan-Newman community detection (edge-bewtweenness)

using the following code:

```{r}
gc <-  edge.betweenness.community(g1)
memb <- membership(gc)
plot(g, vertex.size=5, vertex.color=memb, asp=FALSE)
View(gc)
```
we get:

### i)

The following colored graph:

### ii) 

The algorithm produced 6 communities with the sizes of 4,5,4,4,4,3 ordered by id.

### iii) 

The modularity value we got is 0.47

## Algorithm 2 - walktrap.community

using the following code:

```{r}
gc1 <- walktrap.community(g1)
gc1
plot(g1,  vertex.size=5, vertex.color=membership(gc1), asp=FALSE)
```
we get:

### i)

The following colored graph:

### ii) 

The algorithm produced 7 communities with the sizes of 7,4,3,3,3,2,2 ordered by size.

### iii) 

The modularity value we got is 0.4

## Question 2

### a)

We have decided to model a twitter's user personal network, which includes the twitter users that he follows or that are following him.
We first start by loading the relevant packeges:

```{r}
#install.packages("twitteR")
#install.packages("igraph")
library("twitteR")
library("igraph")
```
Then, we set up the twitter oauth connection:

```{r}
consumer_key <- "my key (left out for security reasons)"
consumer_secret <- "my secret (left out for security reasons)"
access_token <- "my token (left out for security reasons)"
access_secret <- "my access secret (left out for security reasons)"
setup_twitter_oauth(consumer_key, consumer_secret,access_token,access_secret)
```

Since we had no twitter accounts, we searched a random user on twitter that has suffiecent number of followers and users that he follows.
we found the user "derectorj" and used him as the center of our network graph.
we start our data collection by getting both of his friends(users that he follows) and followers IDs, and then converting the IDs to names. we limit the number of connections to each group (freinds and followers) to be 20, for better looking graph.

```{r}
num_of_connections=20
friendsIDs<-lookupUsers(center$getFriendIDs())
followersIDs<-lookupUsers(center$getFollowerIDs())
friends <- sapply(friendsIDs[1:num_of_connections],name)
followers <- sapply(followersIDs[1:num_of_connections],name)
```
in the next sections we will describe the rest of the process

### b)

We defined our nodes to be twitter users that are either following or followed by our center user(derectorj).
our graph is directed, and an edge from x to y represents that the user x is following the user y.
to acheive this edge list, we created a dataframe with two columns - "User" that represent a twitter user (the x in our edge)
and "Following" that represents the twitter user that user x is following (y in our edge).

```{r}
edges <- merge(data.frame(User='derectorj', Following=friends), data.frame(User=followers, Following='derectorj'), all=T)
```

### c)

After having both nodes and edges, we create a directed grpah as explained above, and plot him:

```{r}
Network <- graph.data.frame(edges, directed = T)
tkplot(Network,vertex.color="lightblue",vertex.size = 20)
```

### d)

we will now answer question one again, this time with our network graph:

### i)

using the following code:

```{r}
bet <- betweenness(Network, v = V(Network), directed = TRUE, weights = NULL,
                   nobigint = TRUE, normalized = FALSE)
which(max(bet) == bet)
```
we discover that **derectorj** is the actor with the highest bewtweenness rank.
we of course expected that to be the answer since our graph was constructed around him.

### ii)

using the following code:

```{r}
clo <- closeness(Network, vids = V(Network),weights = NULL, normalized = FALSE)
which(max(clo) == clo)
```
we discover that there are 20 nodes with the same highest closeness rank.
these 20 nodes are all the nodes with an edge that is coming out of them to the center(derectorj).
the rest of the nodes have no outgoing edges and therefore their closeness rank is lower.

### iii)

we used the following code:

```{r}
eig <- eigen_centrality(Network, directed = TRUE, scale = TRUE, weights = NULL,
                        options = arpack_defaults)
```
but our graph is directed and acyclic and therefore all eigenvector centralities are zeros
